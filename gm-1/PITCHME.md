# Motivation

- why do you **need** to know about machine learning |
- examples how ML is taken role in all areas |
- Also, **Science Aplicattions** |

---

# What ML can do? 

 - **Classification** : take decisions |

 - **Regression** : give an output |

#### Examples of Classification methods
several slides here

#### Examples of Regression applications

# Where can machines outperform humans?

---

# ==Deep Learning localization== Digital Holographic Microscopy 

 Do you believe??
 
 ---
# DHM phase simulations

- Phase for 1 emitter different from 2 emitter overlaped |
- Always? |
- Can we teach a CNN to localize? |
- What would be the resolution limit? |
